Introduction
We , here at Valor aim at being a platform to bring into a rural egalitarian consensus , by bringing the fruits of the hardwork of the rural women closer to them .

The after effect of the increase in the tech infrastructure has still not reached  the women in our villages , and where it has , they fall prey to the middlemen who brim over false promises to them .

Mission
Our mission is to strengthen the skillset and leadership of rural women.
Vision
We envision a self reliant women working class , who are empowered and nurtured enough to bring them to their full potential.

What motivated us to create this website ??? 
What is our USP??

Their supression was our suppression.
Our women work tirelessly . We aim to get away with the economic hindrances that they encounter . Empowering these women upholding the tradition and culture of the country is the core of our cumulative efforts .
Our target group of end producers would be in the age 23-55. 
Our skill enrichment videos  can be accessed even with a weak internet connection , mobile or pc both would do  . They are curated to keep you updated with the latest trends from the most authentic of the creator available, thus distinguishing our video library from the at present video platforms
We envision a tie up with the local government authorities to do away with the fake materials being circuited around , and thus ensuring both the end producer and the end consumer are satisfied .
